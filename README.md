# Evolving Camouflage with Compositional Pattern Producing Networks in Rhino Grasshopper

Grasshopper component that implements a CPPN from scratch to evolve camouflage designs

Camouflage designs are tested against background images of natural scenes using the following three metrics:

Luminance Comparison

Edge Detectability using Gabor Filters

Feature Matching using SURF features
